Challenge
Medium

In this challenge, you'll implement administrative functions for a library management system.

You'll need to modify the library.py file to add a get_statistics method to the Library class that returns a dictionary with key statistics about the library's state. The implementation details are provided in TODO comments within the file.

The statistics should include:

    Total number of books
    Available books count
    Borrowed books count
    Total users count
    Number of users with borrowed books

The book.py and user.py files contain pre-implemented classes that your solution will interact with. While you can review these files to understand the system structure, your implementation should focus on the library.py file.
