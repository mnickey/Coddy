Medium

In this challenge, you'll implement a library management system with borrowing functionality.

Implement the required functionality in the following files:

    book.py - Contains Book class definition
    user.py - Contains User class definition
    library.py - Contains Library class where you'll implement the borrow_book method

Follow the TODO comments in each file for step-by-step implementation guidance. The borrow_book method should handle various scenarios including book/user not found and availability checks.
