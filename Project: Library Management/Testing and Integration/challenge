In this challenge, you'll implement a multi-file library system with comprehensive test coverage. You'll work with three editable files that contain detailed TODO comments guiding your implementation:

    book.py - Contains the Book class definition
    user.py - Contains the User class you need to implement
    library.py - Contains the Library class definition
