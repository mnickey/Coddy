Challenge
Medium

In this challenge, you'll implement a library management system with book search functionality.

You'll work with three editable files:

    book.py - Contains the Book class definition
    user.py - Contains the User class definition
    library.py - Contains the Library class where you'll implement search functionality

Follow the TODO comments in each file to implement the required functionality. Your main task is to add a search_by_title method to the Library class that performs case-insensitive searches on book titles.
