Challenge
Easy

In this challenge, you'll implement a flexible number utility function.

Edit the number_utils.py file to implement the sum_all_numbers function that accepts any number of numeric arguments and returns their sum. The function should:

    Return 0 if no arguments are provided
    Print "Error: All arguments must be numbers" and return None if any non-numeric arguments are provided

The number_utils.py file contains detailed TODO comments to guide your implementation. Follow these comments carefully to ensure your solution meets all requirements.
