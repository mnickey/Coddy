Challenge
Easy

In this challenge, you'll implement a context manager class that measures elapsed time between entering and exiting a context block.

    timer.py - Contains the Timer class implementation (this is the file you'll edit)
    driver.py - Contains comprehensive test cases (do not modify)

Implement the Timer context manager in timer.py following the TODO comments. The class should:

    Record start time when entering a context
    Record end time when exiting
    Calculate and display the elapsed time
