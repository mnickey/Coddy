Challenge
Medium

In this challenge, you'll implement a media library system using both inheritance and composition patterns.

You need to edit the following files, following the TODO comments within each:

    media.py, book.py, movie.py, musicalbum.py - For the inheritance implementation
    mediaitem.py, bookcomposition.py, moviecomposition.py, musicalbumcomposition.py - For the composition implementation

Each media type should have:

    Title, creator (author/director/artist), and year attributes
    Appropriate display_info() method
