Challenge
Easy

In this challenge, you'll implement the Command class in command.py following object-oriented principles. The file contains detailed TODO comments guiding your implementation step-by-step.

Only modify command.py according to the TODO comments.

Your implementation will be thoroughly tested by driver.py, which contains comprehensive test scenarios including:

    Basic functionality validation
    Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values)
    Inheritance and polymorphism validation
    Method behavior under various conditions
    Proper encapsulation and attribute access
