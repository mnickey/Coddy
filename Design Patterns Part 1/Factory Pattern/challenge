In this challenge, you'll implement a shape factory system using proper object-oriented design with inheritance and polymorphism.

Complete the implementation in the following files:

    shape.py - Base Shape class
    circle.py - Circle implementation
    rectangle.py - Rectangle implementation
    triangle.py - Triangle implementation
    shapefactory.py - Factory class to create shapes

Each file contains detailed TODO comments to guide your implementation. Follow these comments carefully to ensure your code meets all requirements.
