Implement a new BitcoinPayment strategy for our shopping system.

Your task is to:

    Create a BitcoinPayment class that implements PaymentStrategy
        It should accept a wallet_address in the constructor
        The pay method should print exactly: Paying $X using Bitcoin wallet: Y where X is the amount and Y is the wallet address
        The pay method should return True after printing
    Write a main function that:
        Creates a shopping cart
        Adds a laptop costing $1200 and headphones costing $100 to the cart
        Creates a BitcoinPayment with the wallet address "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa"
        Sets this payment strategy on the cart
        Calls the checkout method

Follow the same structure as shown in the lesson examples. Don't forget to add the conditional if __name__ == "__main__": to call your main function.
