Implement the Observer Pattern by creating a weather monitoring system. Your task is to:

    Create a WeatherStation class that extends the Subject class
        Add a private attribute to track the current temperature
        Implement set_temperature(temperature) to update the temperature and notify observers
        Implement get_temperature() to return the current temperature
    Create a WeatherDisplay class that extends the Observer class
        Each display should have a name
        When notified of a temperature change, it should display a message

The message format for temperature updates should be exactly:

Display [name]: Current temperature is [temperature]C

For example: Display Phone: Current temperature is 25.5C

Your solution should allow multiple displays to observe a single weather station, and displays should be able to be added or removed from the station's notification list.
