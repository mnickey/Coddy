Challenge
Medium

In this challenge, you'll implement a Deck class that simulates a deck of playing cards with comprehensive functionality and proper Python conventions.

You only need to edit the deck.py file. Follow the TODO comments in the code which guide you through implementing:

    A standard 52-card deck initialization (using strings like "2H", "KD", "AS")
    Support for Python's built-in operations:
        Indexing (deck[0])
        Length checking (len(deck))
        Iteration (for card in deck)
        Membership testing ("AS" in deck)
    A shuffle method to randomize card order
