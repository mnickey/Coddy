Challenge
Medium

In this challenge, you'll implement a fully functional CustomList class that mimics Python's built-in list behavior while demonstrating your understanding of special methods.

Edit only the customlist.py file following the TODO comments that guide your implementation step-by-step.

Your implementation should support:

    Initialization with optional items
    Indexing (getting/setting values)
    Length checking with len()
    Addition with other lists
    String representation
    Iteration and contains checks
    Methods: append, pop, and clear
