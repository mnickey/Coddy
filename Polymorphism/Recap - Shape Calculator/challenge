In this challenge, you'll implement a shape calculator system that demonstrates polymorphism.

Implement the required classes in the following files (look for TODO comments in each file):

    shape.py - Define the abstract Shape base class
    circle.py - Implement the Circle class
    rectangle.py - Implement the Rectangle class
    triangle.py - Implement the Triangle class
    unknownshape.py - Create a non-derived class demonstrating duck typing
    shapecalculator.py - Implement the calculator functionality

Follow the TODO comments in each file for step-by-step guidance. The comprehensive test suite will help you understand the expected behavior and ensure your implementation handles all requirements correctly.
