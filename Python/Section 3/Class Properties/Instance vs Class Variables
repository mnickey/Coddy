Instance vs Class Variables

Instance variables are unique to each object, while class variables are shared by all objects of the same class.
Here is an example of a class with both types of variables

class Student:
    # Class variable - shared by all instances
    school = "Python High School"
    
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        # Instance variables - unique to each student
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade

Create student objects:

alice = Student("Alice", "A")
bob = Student("Bob", "B")

Access instance variables (unique to each object):

print(alice.name)  # Alice
print(bob.name)    # Bob
print(alice.grade) # A
print(bob.grade)   # B

Access class variables (shared by all objects):

print(alice.school)     # Python High School
print(bob.school)       # Python High School
print(Student.school)   # Python High School

Now change the class variable:

Student.school = "Python Academy"

Check how the change affects all instances:

print(alice.school)   # Python Academy
print(bob.school)     # Python Academy

Output:

Alice
Bob
A
B
Python High School
Python High School
Python High School
Python Academy
Python Academy

You can also create instance variables after object creation:

alice.age = 16  # This creates an instance variable
print(alice.age)  # 16
# print(bob.age)  # This would cause an error - bob doesn't have age

Key Difference: Instance variables (created with self.variable_name) are unique to each object, while class variables (defined directly in the class) are shared by all objects. Changing a class variable affects all instances.

Challenge
Easy

Complete a banking system.. You'll define a BankAccount class in one file and use it in another.

You'll work with:

    bank_account.py: Define the BankAccount class with attributes and methods
    driver.py: Import the class, create accounts, and demonstrate class variables

Follow the TODO comments in both files for step-by-step instructions. The comments will guide you through creating the class with proper variables, methods, and showing how class variables affect all instances.
